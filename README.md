Websites build with .html are not secure.Users can get the links of the .html and they can

literally scrape all the details or the information present on the website. Try building your

website using Pyscript its more secure and not easily hackable. The main advantage or disadvantage with

building website with pyscript is that since its the python on browser even a small tiny bug is not accepted

by the page.Pyscript has a different way of website building.It has single .html page and that page

gets updated every time you click a new link unlike having multiple pages and shifing to new page link

everytime.Because your syntax and indentation has to be correct its little harder to create website using

Pyscript but its more secure and not easily hackable.
